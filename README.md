Machine Learning model to predict diabetes 
Objective:
 ▪ Predict the onset of diabetes using historical data and supervised learning classification techniques.

Data Inspection and Preprocessing:
 ▪ Removed unwanted variables and handled missing values.
 ▪ Split the data into training and testing sets for robust model evaluation.

 Machine Learning Algorithms:
 ▪ Applied three classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifier.
 ▪ Evaluated performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results:
 ▪ Random Forest Classifier emerged as the most suitable model with an accuracy of 0.959 and an F1-score of 0.83.
 ▪ Effectively reduced overfitting, achieving a high true positive rate of 1913 and a low false positive rate of 117.
 ▪ Visualized results using confusion matrices and ROC curves.

Key Takeaways:
 ▪ Predictive models can significantly aid in early detection and management of diabetes.

Suitability of Algorithms:
 ▪ The Random Forest classification algorithm proved to be the most suitable for diabetes prediction, achieving the highest accuracy and F1-score compared to Decision Tree and Logistic Regression algorithms.
